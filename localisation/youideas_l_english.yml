 yue_heroes:0 "Yue Heroism"
 yue_heroes_desc:0 "The Yue - who we name our region from - were the people directly related to the grand leader Yue Han, whose early diplomatic and administrative biddings have given us high degrees of autonomy from the Ming. His notoriety as a commander in the Cantonese rebellion had him defeat far larger numbers."
 true_meritocracy:0 "True Meritocracy"
 true_meritocracy_desc:0 "Zhongguo's very core is the concept of competence being directly linked to one's position. Competent people become legends. Incompetent people die in time. This ideal is enforced by the rest of the middle kingdom only superficially; our state must ensure that we do not fall to corruption or bias."

 river_and_sea_sailing_desc:0 "The Pearl estuary ensures our trade with the inland provinces, whereas the sea ensures our trade with the sea provinces and other nations. The very survival of our economy is controlling the trade in river and sea."

 tuntian_in_emergencies_desc:0 "The Tun-Tian system was an ancient Chinese system for provinces newly conquered by warlords at periods of civil war. Because these provinces tend to be border provinces, the system enforces that every able-bodied man shall fight for it's defense, and everyone else shall farm under high state taxation during times of war. This'll ensure our country shall be fed and armed when rivaled."
 neo_confucian_usury:0 "Neo-Confucian Usury"
 neo_confucian_usury_desc:0 "A new form of Confucianism is spreading across the Confucian world, seemingly in coordination with our expansion, at rapid speed. If we, as the largest Confucian country, endorse a usury dogma, we should be able to get away with minting and recalling coins more easily - and the best part is that the population will blissfully think we're doing a holy duty."
