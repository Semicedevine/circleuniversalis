 SEM_ideas_bonus:0 "Semician Ambition"
 SEM_idea_1:0 "Political Infiltration"
 SEM_idea_1_desc:0 "There are many nearby nations who oppose, and by extension, oppose the will of Semice. This is intolerable, and we must spend every effort to infiltrate and subvert their structures to benefit us."
 SEM_idea_2:0 "Land Collectivization"
 SEM_idea_2_desc:0 "For too long, the land has been held by greedy aristocrats who profit off of the toils of the people! It is the will of Semice that from now on all land shall be owned by the government. This will most certainly help the impoverished rather than merely serving to line our pockets."
 SEM_idea_3:0 "Forced Relocation"
 SEM_idea_3_desc:0 "Unfortunately, there are some who do not wish to loyally serve Semice, and instead plot his demise. They shall be flung out into the wastes, colonizing it to spread Semice's power."
 SEM_idea_4:0 "People's Army"
 SEM_idea_4_desc:0 "The people rejoice to fight for Semice, flocking to his banners, for they know that the land which Semice desires is for their own benefit. That commissars are executing those that refuse the draft is merely an unfounded conspiracy."
 SEM_idea_5:0 "Gulags"
 SEM_idea_5_desc:0 "Even still, there are those within our country who whisper of opposing Semice. We must disappear them to Siberia, were they will work to atone for their crimes."
 SEM_idea_6:0 "Red Army"
 SEM_idea_6_desc:0 "Semice has decreed that our army is not large enough, it must be doubled if we are to fight off our mortal enemies in China. As such, we have tripled it, for we must give our all for Semice! Our quadrupling of the army will surely bring rest of the world to it's knees."
 SEM_idea_7:0 "General Winter"
 SEM_idea_7_desc:0 "Should, perchance, some enemy defeat our invincible infantry armies with something silly like artillery, we shall retreat through Russia. Semice's old friend, General Winter, will deal with these puny worms."
